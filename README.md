## About DeepAgent

DeepAgent represents a paradigm shift in AI agents, moving from rigid ReAct-style loops to a unified "stream of thought" that autonomously discovers and uses tools.

### Key Innovations

1. **Unified Reasoning Process** - Seamless integration of thinking, tool discovery, and execution
2. **Autonomous Memory Folding** - Intelligent context compression to prevent error accumulation
3. **ToolPO Training** - Stable reinforcement learning with LLM-simulated APIs

## Local Development
